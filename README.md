# smw-android
A port of SMW to Android. <br>

Original Repository: https://github.com/snesrev/smw <br>

Use the instructions on the original repository to extract the smw.dat file from your rom and put it in Android/data/net.freyta.smw/files <br>
Running the app once will create the directory. <br>

NOTE: Controller only. No touch controls yet. <br>

How to Change Settings: <br>
Android/data/net.freyta.smw/files contains smw.ini. Use a text editor to change options. <br>

Default Settings:<br>
L3 Save State <br>
R3 Load State <br>

This is a cobbled together version from [Waterdish](https://github.com/Waterdish/zelda3-android). Full credit goes to them, I just ported the SMW code over.
